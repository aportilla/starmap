//
// Mostly constants plus one merge helper. The Architect (in
// procgen-architect.mjs) reads these to sample per-system architecture: how many planets
// a star is likely to host, where they sit in orbit, what mass/radius mix

// The Filler reads its own (smaller) prior set; this file is the
// Architect's tuning surface.
//
// === Realistic base, gameplay tune layered on top ===
// Sections we've intentionally biased away from physical realism for
// game-feel reasons keep two blocks side-by-side:
//   - `*_REALISTIC` — scientifically anchored against published exoplanet
//     statistics (Dressing & Charbonneau 2015 for M-dwarf occurrence;
//     Petigura et al. 2018 / Hsu et al. 2019 for Kepler FGK; Wright et al.
//     2012 for hot Jupiter rate). This block is what the universe
//     actually looks like as best we can tell.
//   - `*_TUNE` — sparse overrides, mentions ONLY the fields we're
//     deliberately pushing away from realistic for gameplay reasons. The
//     header comment on each TUNE block explains the player-visible
//     effect we're after.
// `mergeTunes()` deep-merges the two and that's what gets exported.
// Reverting a section to pure realism is a one-block deletion.
//
// Sections without a `*_TUNE` peer are exported directly as realistic —
// either we're satisfied with the calibration, or the field isn't yet
// known to need a thumb on the scale. Add the realistic/tune split when
// you start to push a section away from reality.
//
// === Bias assumption ===
// The catalog is treated as dramatically incomplete for every star. The
// Architect samples toward these target counts regardless of how many
// catalog rows already exist on a star, then anchors catalog rows into
// their slots and fills the rest. So PLANET_COUNT_BY_CLASS reflects
// expected TOTAL bodies (catalog + procgen), not just procgen extras.
//
// === Sampling conventions ===
// `{ mean, sd, min, max }` blocks describe a truncated normal:
// sample N(mean, sd), clamp to [min, max]. Round to integer where the
// field is a count. Where a log-normal is more physically accurate
// (orbital spacing ratios, planet mass), the comment calls it out and the
// Architect's sampler is expected to log-transform.
//
// === Versioning ===
// PROCGEN_VERSION is the seed-suffix hook. The Filler/Architect mix it
// into every PRNG seed; bumping it reseeds the entire galaxy without
// touching CSV ids. Per-generator version suffixes are layered on top.

import { sampleLogTruncated } from './prng.mjs';

// Deep merge a sparse `tune` over `base`. Plain objects are merged
// recursively (so a tune entry can override a single nested field without
// restating its siblings); everything else — primitives, arrays — is
// replaced wholesale. Use a named record (not an array) if you need
// partial overrides on what would otherwise be an ordered list.

//      author values verbatim (Earth = `carbon_aqueous, complex`;
//      Mars = `n/a, n/a` for sterile; etc.). The Filler uses these
//      as-is and computes surfaceImpact from the body's measured
//      productivity × per-body coupling for the authored archetype.
//   2. Procgen-derived — both cells blank on a CSV row means
//      "procgen target." The Filler runs argmax over the six
//      productivity scalars (productivityPreAtm + productivityPostAtm)
//      to pick archetype, applies per-archetype complexity thresholds
//      to bucket complexity, then derives surfaceImpact the same way
//      as the authored path.
//
// Complexity and surfaceImpact are split because they pull apart at the
// edges. Earth was chemically dominant in atmosphere for ~2 Gyr (post-
// GOE, pre-Cambrian) on entirely microbial life — high impact, low
// complexity. A complex Europa subsurface biosphere never touches the
// surface — high complexity, no impact. One ladder can't represent both.
